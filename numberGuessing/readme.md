## Number Guessing Game in Python 🎮

## Description
  A simple number guessing game where the user sets a range, and the system randomly chooses a number within it. After each guess, the game gives feedback to help the user adjust their next guess.

  This project idea was inspired by the [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/number-guessing-game-in-python/). I implemented it independently and added a try...except statement to prevent the program from crashing by handling potential errors, such as invalid user input.

*Demo of how the number guessing game works, including user input and feedback.*
